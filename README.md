# Digital-Dashboard-Documentation
It aims to produce the main document that details a Digital Dashboard representing some major Business Operational views of an Organisation.

The main ‘Digital’ technology it will be initially aimed at is Tableau: Business Intelligence and Analytics Software.

It would roughly go from Concept/Executive Summary/Statement of User Requirements and Acceptance Criteria, then to (more detailed) Business and Technical Requirements, Development Plan/Requirements, Testing Plan/Requirements, Implementation, Training, Maintenance, including ongoing Knowledge Capture of Usage and Periodic Review (for improvement and tuning).

I feel the case for producing this that there is a lack of formal documentation for dashboards, which tend to evolve organically and most critically lack the capture of knowledge around how the data presented is used and interpreted.
